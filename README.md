# HW07 - Business Corp Employee Management System
Name: Hunter Johnson
Date: 3/16/2022

## Required Files
* Employee.h - Employee.cpp: the employee class and its function definitions
* Supervisor.h - Supervisor.cpp: the supervisor class a derived employee class and its definitions
* Officer.h - Officer.cpp: the officer class a derived employee class and its definitons
* Iostream - iostream big good
* Makefile - compiles the program to be run
* main.cpp - the general brains of the program, the runner

## Compilation Instructions
Make sure everything is working and run the make

## Program usage
To run the program, run it on emacs.
In the form that was requested it does not require any user input as the values are set in stone and not something that would be changed, had the requester for this program requested it be inputed from a file or user input then based on the type of employee the program would expect input for at minimum, ID, years worked, hours worked, and the hourly rate and then if its a derived employee either evilness or number of employees supervised.

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* What is working?
* I mean its doing exactly what the requirements asked for so its working.
* What are the limitations of your program?
* Can't take unique user input, to change the output one has to go into the file and change the values
* What design decisions did you make?
* Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to? (cool trick, extra credit, strange logic, problem area, etc)
