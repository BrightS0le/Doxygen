Make sure everything is working and run the make\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Program usage}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
To run the program, run it on emacs. In the form that was requested it does not require any user input as the values are set in stone and not something that would be changed, had the requester for this program requested it be inputed from a file or user input then based on the type of employee the program would expect input for at minimum, ID, years worked, hours worked, and the hourly rate and then if its a derived employee either evilness or number of employees supervised.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Notes}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
Any extra notes, such as\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item What is working?
\item I mean its doing exactly what the requirements asked for so its working.
\item What are the limitations of your program?
\item Can\textquotesingle{}t take unique user input, to change the output one has to go into the file and change the values
\item What design decisions did you make?
\item Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to? (cool trick, extra credit, strange logic, problem area, etc)
