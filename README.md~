# HW07 - Business Corp Employee Management System
Name: Hunter Johnson
Date: 3/16/2022

## Required Files
* Employee.h - Employee.cpp: the employee class and its function definitions
* Supervisor.h - Supervisor.cpp: the supervisor class a derived employee class and its definitions
* Officer.h - Officer.cpp: the officer class a derived employee class and its definitons
* Iostream - iostream big good
* Makefile - compiles the program to be run
* main.cpp - the general brains of the program, the runner

## Compilation Instructions
I really don't know what you want here, do you want me to explain how in the hell the computer compiles it? or like do you want me to say the full instructions of pulling it up on emacs? 

## Program usage
To run the program, run it on emacs. What does "How do we run the program mean?" like how am I supposed to anwser that?
In the form that was requested it does not require any user input as the values are set in stone and not something that would be changed, had the requester for this program requested it be inputed from a file or user input then based on the type of employee the program would expect input for at minimum, ID, years worked, hours worked, and the hourly rate and then if its a derived employee either evilness or number of employees supervised.

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* What is working?
* I mean its doing exactly what the requirements asked for so its working.
* What are the limitations of your program?
* Can't take unique user input, to change the output one has to go into the file and change the values
* What design decisions did you make?
* I hated the way the comments and stuff in main looked, with my ADHD it made it impossible to read so I changed it, but like what design decision could I have made, you lay out the entire program and all its functions for me so I don't have to think about design or anything like that
* Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to? (cool trick, extra credit, strange logic, problem area, etc)
* Not really just for this, but if you could make like a easy to understand Step 1,2,3 type list for how to do the emacs split screen for having multiple files open and how to do it that would be great because opening 4 terminals and signing in on each of them is a pain
